### Audio Programmer | Software Engineer | Sound Specialist

I am a Software Developer with a unique background: over 10 years of professional experience in Sound Engineering and Event Production. Currently completing the advanced curriculum at **42 Berlin**, I am bridging the gap between low-level programming and audio artistry.

My goal is to leverage my expertise in acoustic physics, signal flow, and large-scale production management to build robust audio tools and immersive sonic experiences for the game/art/event industry.
